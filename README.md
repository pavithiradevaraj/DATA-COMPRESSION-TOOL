Description:

Data compression is the process of reducing the size of data to save space or transmission time. It is widely used in areas such as file storage, data transfer, and multimedia processing. In this C program, we will build a simple data compression tool using the Huffman Coding algorithm. Huffman Coding is a widely used lossless data compression technique that works by replacing frequently occurring characters with shorter codes and less frequent characters with longer codes.

Program Overview


The goal of this program is to:


1.Read input data (text, for simplicity).

2.Analyze the frequency of characters in the input data.

3.Build a Huffman Tree based on the frequencies of the characters.

4.Generate Huffman codes for each character.

5.Compress the data by replacing characters with their corresponding Huffman codes.

6.Write the compressed data into a new file.

Steps Involved

1.Frequency Analysis: The first step is to scan the input file and calculate the frequency of each character.


2.Building the Huffman Tree: Using the character frequencies, we construct a binary tree. This is done by repeatedly merging the two nodes with the lowest frequencies until only one node remains.


3.Generating Huffman Codes: Once the tree is built, the Huffman code for each character is generated by traversing the tree. The path to a character is represented as a series of '0's (left) and '1's (right).


4.Compression: Each character in the input file is replaced by its corresponding Huffman code, resulting in a compressed binary representation.
Writing the Compressed File: The final step is to write the compressed data to an output file.
